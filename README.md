A project made for an imaginary online academy called Command Break.

Backstory:

I was thinking about making a new project for my portfolio, and after a while of brainstorming, I landed on creating an imaginary online coding academy's website. Therefore, I needed to decide what the name of the academy will essentially be. I landed on the name "Command Break", the word "Command" refers to any commands and declarations by the code that people write, and the word "Break" is an expression of some of the attributes found in codes, such as line *break* in HTML.


Design:

So now, after deciding the main idea of the website, we need to figure out what the design will actually be like. Since it was a website related to *code*, it needed to have modern colours, as well as a modern interface in general. And after thinking for some time, I decided to land on a shade of red, and a shade of black, as well as the colour gold and white, to complete the colour palette.


Results:

After coding and designing the website, the results were pretty satisfying in my perspective. If you wish to see the results, you can check it out on my YouTube channel:
